 <b>   About </b> </p>
 <div class="box">
I am very fond of cats, especially big cats.<br>
    The cat is a domestic animal. Its scientific name is Felis catus. It is a small animal that belongs to the “Felidae” family. The cat is the only domesticated species of the family. Other members include tigers, panthers, etc. Cats are adorable animals and are petted by lots of people in the world. They are playful and spending time with them reduces stress and anxiety. Shoutout to cats, i love the cute kitties with their murder claws.

Cats are of three types- house cats, farm cats and feral cats. House cats are the cats we pet in our houses. Cats become good friends of humans. Unlike dogs, cats are not very active around their owners.


There are seven official "big cats" in the Panthera genus:
<list>    
<li>1. Tiger:The biggest of them all, known for their orange coat and black stripes. Unlike most cats, they love water and are powerful swimmers!</li>
    <li>2. Lion:The only big cat that lives in social groups (prides). Males have majestic manes, and their roars can be heard up to 5 miles away!</li>
        <li>3. Jaguar:Found in the Americas, they have the strongest bite of any big cat, capable of crushing turtle shells</li>
            <li>4. Leopard: Super stealthy climbers that can drag prey twice their body weight up a tree. They also come in a rare black (melanistic) form known as a black panther.</li>
                <li>5. Snow Leopard: Found in the mountains of Central Asia, they have the longest tail(relative to body size) for balance in rocky terrain.</li>
                    <li>6. Cheetah: The fastest land animal, hitting speeds of 70 mph (113 km/h) in short bursts. Unlike other big cats, they can't roar—only purr and chirp!</li>
                        <li>7. Clouded Leopard:Smaller and super elusive, with the largest canine teeth relative to skull size among all cats!</li>
                        </list>
